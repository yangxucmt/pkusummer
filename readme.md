# PKU summer course on geometry in condensed matter physics

【主讲人】

Xu Yang (Ohio State University)

【摘要】

 I will focus on the role of geometry and topology in quantum matter. In order to give students a flavor of the ubiquity of geometry and topology in physics, I will freely draw on mathematical tools in solving physics-motivated problems. Topics including crystalline defects, topological ordered states and tensor network states will be discussed. Mathematical tools of algebraic topology will be used extensively.

This short course will be lectures aiming at providing students with a perspective of the role of geometry and topology in condensed matter physics. Students with a general physics and math background (~level of sophomore) and a certain degree of mathematical maturity are encouraged to enroll.
